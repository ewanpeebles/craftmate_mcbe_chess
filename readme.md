# CraftMate - Minecraft Bedrock Chess

> [!CAUTION]
> This project isn't even in alpha yet. Nothing in this repository is supported or designed to work yet. v0.0.1 is currently in progress.

You can view this project's documentation at my [GitHub Pages site.](https://ewanpeebles.github.io/craftmate_mcbe_chess/)

This project was built with [bridge.](https://bridge-core.app), a Minecraft Bedrock project manager and editor. Images and models were designed in [Blockbench.](https://www.blockbench.net)

> [!TIP]
> Most of the scripting was done in TypeScript, which bridge. automatically transpiles into JavaScript. However, Minecraft cannot parse TypeScript. It is recommended to use the most recent `.mcaddon` file published under the releases section to use this addon instead of manually putting the project code in the `com.mojang` folder.
